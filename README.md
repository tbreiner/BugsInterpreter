# BugsInterpreter

This project involved building up all steps necessary to recognize, parse, interpret, and execute code written in a plain text file. The code for this interpreter must be written in the Bugs language, which is a simple invented language that commands small "bugs" on a screen to move in various ways, which is perfect to use for practicing the techniques of parsing and interpreting code. 

This project was created by completing several assignments by David Matuszek at the University of Pennsylvania. The following links explain the behavior of the Bugs language and its BNF Grammar:

The interpreted code can be visualized through an included GUI that allows the user to select an input .txt file containing plain text code in the Bugs language, and then allows the user to interact with the code's output images in various ways.

Several example files have been included but any user can create a new program in a .txt file and see their "bugs" come to life by following the BNF rules of the Bugs language, described in the above link.
